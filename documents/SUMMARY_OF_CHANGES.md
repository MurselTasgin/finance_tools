# Summary of Changes - Download Progress & Job Management

## Session Overview

Fixed and improved the download progress tracking and job management UI based on user requirements.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Download Progress Tracking Analysis

**File:** `DOWNLOAD_PROGRESS_ANALYSIS.md` & `PROGRESS_DISPLAY_STATUS.md`

**What was checked:**
- How `downloader.py` sends progress updates
- How backend `progress_callback` processes messages
- What frontend displays in real-time

**Findings:**
- ✅ Chunk counts: Working perfectly (X/Y chunks displayed)
- ✅ Downloaded records (live): Updates in real-time with visual indicator
- ✅ Progress log per chunk: Detailed logs with date ranges and record counts
- ✅ Per-fund progress: Tracked and displayed
- ⚠️ Inserted records: Not separately tracked from downloaded records

**Current Flow:**
```
Downloader → Progress Callback → Backend State → Frontend (1s polling) → Live Display
```

---

### 2. ✅ Running Tasks Not Showing in Download Manager

**File:** `DOWNLOAD_MANAGER_FIX.md`

**Problem:**
- Download History showed "running" tasks from database
- Download Manager showed tasks from in-memory dictionary only
- Mismatch occurred on server restart

**Root Cause:**
- History: Queries database (persistent)
- Manager: Queries memory (cleared on restart)

**Solution Implemented:**

#### A. Startup Handler
```python
@app.on_event("startup")
async def startup_event():
    # Clean up orphaned 'running' tasks on server restart
    # Marks them as 'failed' with error message
```

#### B. Repository Method
```python
def cleanup_orphaned_running_tasks(self) -> int:
    # Finds all status='running' tasks
    # Marks as 'failed' with appropriate error
```

#### C. Enhanced Tasks Endpoint
```python
@app.get("/api/database/tasks")
async def get_active_tasks():
    # Combines tasks from BOTH memory AND database
    # Adds 'source' field ('memory' or 'database')
```

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/main.py` (startup handler + enhanced endpoint)
- `finance_tools/etfs/tefas/repository.py` (cleanup method)

### 3. ✅ Unified Download Jobs UI

**File:** `UNIFIED_DOWNLOAD_JOBS_UI.md`

**User Request:**
> "Let's make it simpler and better by having only 1 tab for Download Jobs. We should be able to see any job (active, finished, cancelled, etc.). When user clicks on a job, he should see the realtime progress if it is active; otherwise all the details and logs if it is finished, cancelled."

**Solution:**
Created a unified **Download Jobs** component that:
- Shows ALL jobs in one table (running, completed, failed, cancelled)
- Click to expand for details
- **Active jobs:** Show real-time progress with live updates
- **Completed jobs:** Show full logs and statistics

**Before (3 separate tabs):**
1. Download Manager (active jobs)
2. Download History (past jobs)  
3. Statistics

**After (2 tabs):**
1. Download Jobs (combined Manager + History with expandable details)
2. Statistics

**Component Structure:**

```typescript
DownloadJobs
├── Job List (table with all jobs)
│   ├── Filter by status
│   ├── Search functionality
│   └── Live status indicators
│
└── Expandable Details (click to expand)
    ├── For Active Jobs:
    │   ├── Real-time progress bar
    │   ├── Live record counts
    │   ├── Chunk progress
    │   ├── Recent activity log
    │   └── Cancel button
    │
    └── For Completed Jobs:
        ├── Summary statistics
        ├── Full progress logs
        ├── Error details (if failed)
        └── Per-chunk information
```

**Files Created:**
- `frontend/src/components/DownloadJobs.tsx` (750+ lines)

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/components/DataManagement.tsx` (simplified tabs)
- `frontend/src/components/DataStatistics.tsx` (made props optional)

**Files Now Obsolete:**
- `frontend/src/components/DownloadManager.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/EnhancedDownloadManager.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/DownloadHistory.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/DetailedProgressViewer.tsx`

## Key Features

### Real-Time Progress Tracking

**Polling Strategy:**
- Download History: 5 seconds
- Active Tasks: 2 seconds

- Job Details: 5 seconds (only when completed job expanded, stops when done)

**Displayed Information:**
- ✅ Progress percentage (0-100%)
- ✅ Records downloaded (live count)
- ✅ Total target records
- ✅ Chunk progress (X/Y)
- ✅ Current phase
- ✅ Recent activity messages
- ✅ Per-fund statistics
- ✅ Duration (elapsed time)
- ✅ Date ranges per chunk

### Job Management

**All Job Statuses:**
- 🟡 Running (with spinning indicator)
- ✅ Completed (green checkmark)
- ❌ Failed (red X with error details)
- ⭕ Cancelled (by user)

**Actions Available:**
- Start new download
- Cancel running job
- View real-time progress
- Review full logs
- Filter and search jobs
