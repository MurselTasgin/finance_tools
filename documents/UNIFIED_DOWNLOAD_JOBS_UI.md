# Unified Download Jobs UI - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Simplified the download management UI by combining **Download Manager** and **Download History** into a single unified **Download Jobs** tab. This provides a better user experience with one place to view and manage all jobs.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Component: `DownloadJobs.tsx` ✅

Created a comprehensive component that combines:
- **Job listing** with filtering and search
- **Real-time progress** for active jobs
- **Detailed logs** for completed jobs
- **Expandable rows** for job details

#### Features:

**Job List View:**
- Table showing all download jobs (running, completed, failed, cancelled)
- Status badges with live updates for running jobs
- Search by date range, fund names, etc.
- Filter by status (All, Running, Completed, Failed, Cancelled)
- Pagination support
- Shows: Date Range, Type, Funds, Status, Duration, Records, Start Time

**Expandable Details:**
- Click any row to expand and see details
- **For Active Jobs:**
  - Real-time progress bar
  - Live record counts (updates every second)
  - Chunk progress (X/Y chunks completed)
  - Current phase indicator
  - Recent activity log (last 10 messages)
  - Cancel button
  
- **For Completed Jobs:**
  - Summary statistics (records downloaded, messages, success/error counts)
  - Full progress logs with timestamps
  - Records count per chunk
  - Fund-specific information
  - Error details (if failed)

**Actions:**
- New Download button (opens modal)
- Refresh button
- Cancel button for active jobs

### 2. Updated `DataManagement.tsx` ✅

Simplified from 4 tabs to 3 tabs:

**Before:**
1. Statistics
2. Download Manager
3. Download History
4. Data Distribution

**After:**
1. Statistics
2. **Download Jobs** (combined Manager + History)
3. Data Distribution

Removed unused imports and dependencies:
- Removed `EnhancedDownloadManager` import
- Removed `DownloadHistory` import
- Removed `downloadProgress` query (now handled inside DownloadJobs)
- Removed `activeTasks` query (now handled inside DownloadJobs)

### 3. Backend Changes (Already Done) ✅

From previous fix:
- Startup handler cleans orphaned 'running' tasks
- `/api/database/tasks` endpoint returns tasks from both memory and database
- Tasks tracked with 'source' field ('memory' or 'database')

## User Experience Flow

### Viewing Jobs

```
User navigates to Data Management > Download Jobs
  ↓
Sees list of all jobs with current status
  ↓
Running jobs show spinning icon + "Running" badge
  ↓
Can filter by status or search
```

### Monitoring Active Job

```
User clicks on a running job row
  ↓
Row expands showing real-time progress
  ↓
Live updates every 1 second:
  - Progress bar (0-100%)
  - Records downloaded count
  - Chunk progress
  - Recent activity messages
  ↓
User can cancel if needed
```

### Reviewing Completed Job

```
User clicks on a completed job row
  ↓
Row expands showing full details
  ↓
Sees:
  - Final statistics
  - All progress logs (scrollable)
  - Per-chunk information
  - Error messages (if failed)
```

## API Calls

The component efficiently manages API calls:

- **History data**: Polled every 5 seconds (refetchInterval: 5000)
- **Active tasks**: Polled every 2 seconds (refetchInterval: 2000)
- **Download progress**: Polled every 1 second (refetchInterval: 1000) - only when active job is expanded
- **Job details**: Fetched only when completed job is expanded, stops polling when job is complete

## Benefits

✅ **Unified View**: One place to see all jobs instead of two separate tabs
✅ **Context Switching**: No need to switch between Manager and History
✅ **Real-time Updates**: Active jobs show live progress automatically
✅ **Efficient**: Details loaded on-demand when user clicks
✅ **Clean UI**: Expandable rows instead of separate pages
✅ **Better Performance**: Smarter API polling (only when needed)
✅ **Status Clarity**: Running jobs clearly marked with animation
