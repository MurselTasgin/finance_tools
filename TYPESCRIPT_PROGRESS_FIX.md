# TypeScript Progress Interface Fix

## Problem
TypeScript compilation error in `DataRepository.tsx` due to incomplete `DownloadProgress` object initialization.

## Error Details
```
TS2345: Argument of type '{ isDownloading: false; progress: number; status: string; }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'DownloadProgress | (() => DownloadProgress)'.
Type '{ isDownloading: false; progress: number; status: string; }' is missing the following properties from type 'DownloadProgress': records_downloaded, total_records, start_time, estimated_completion, current_phase
```

## Root Cause
The `useState<DownloadProgress>` initialization was using the old progress structure that only had 3 properties, but the enhanced `DownloadProgress` interface now requires 8 properties.

## Solution
Updated the initial state to include all required properties from the `DownloadProgress` interface:

**Before**:
```typescript
const [downloadProgress, setDownloadProgress] = useState<DownloadProgress>({
  isDownloading: false,
  progress: 0,
  status: '',
});
```

**After**:
```typescript
const [downloadProgress, setDownloadProgress] = useState<DownloadProgress>({
  isDownloading: false,
  progress: 0,
  status: '',
  records_downloaded: 0,
  total_records: 0,
  start_time: null,
  estimated_completion: null,
  current_phase: '',
});
```

## Verification
All `setDownloadProgress` calls in the component were already updated to include the complete interface:

1. **Error Handler**: ✅ Complete with all properties
2. **Download Handler**: ✅ Complete with all properties  
3. **Progress Sync**: ✅ Uses server data directly

## Result
- ✅ TypeScript compilation error resolved
- ✅ All progress properties properly initialized
- ✅ Real-time progress bar fully functional
- ✅ Type safety maintained throughout component

The fix ensures that the initial state matches the enhanced `DownloadProgress` interface, resolving the TypeScript error while maintaining all the real-time progress tracking functionality.
